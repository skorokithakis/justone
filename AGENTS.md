- Always run `pre-commit run -a` after every edit.
- Always run `jj describe -m` after every change, to describe the changes that have taken place in THE WHOLE SESSION so far. Don't run `jj diff`, just describe what you've done so far.
- Never try to run a server and test things, tell the human to test.
