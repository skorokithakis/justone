# Just One Helper

A digital companion app for the board game "Just One" - a cooperative party game where players work together to guess mystery words.

## How to play Just One

### Game overview
Just One is a cooperative party game where one player (the guesser) tries to guess a mystery word based on one-word clues given by other players. The catch: duplicate clues are eliminated before the guesser sees them.

### Using this app

#### Setup
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser on your phone or tablet.
2. Select your language (English or Greek).
3. Use the fullscreen button (⛶) in the top-right corner for the best experience.

#### For the guesser
1. Click **"Get Word"** to display a random mystery word.
2. A 2-second countdown appears before revealing the word.
3. Show the screen to other players (not the guesser!) so they can see the word.
4. The other players write their one-word clues on paper or boards.
5. After removing duplicates, the remaining clues are shown to the guesser.

#### For clue givers
1. Click **"Type Clue"** to enter your one-word clue digitally.
2. Type your clue (only single words are allowed - no spaces).
3. The clue displays fullscreen for easy viewing.
4. Compare with other players to identify and remove duplicates.
